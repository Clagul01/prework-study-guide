# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The Prework Study Guide Webpage was created with the intnention of providing students with a clear and concise webpage, featuring the topics of HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript to help them succeed in their prework assignments.

This project was built as part of an introduction to the fundamental blocks of web development, in order to learn and practice using HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript. In creating this Study Guide, not only have I as the developer learned these topics, but have also produced a webpage detailing fact in order to help other students alike.

This solves the problem of having to search around the internet for information, as it is all stored clearly on the same webpage.
